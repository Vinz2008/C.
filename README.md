# C.


A programming language compiler written in C++ which is definitely not finished. It compile the C. code to LLVM IR.

## Advantages

- simple C-like language
- blazingly fast compile times
- predictable name-mangling
- less than 500 KB stripped, ≈12MB not stripped
- classes support
- goto support
- automatic casting

## Cloning the git repo

To clone the git repo, run 

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Vinz2008/C.
```

## WASM support

You can compile C. code to wasm using the ```-target-triplet wasm32-unknown-wasi``` option

## TODO

- [ ] Generics support
- [x] Importing structs with function members
- [ ] Finish refactoring the code for operators to make it compatible with every types
- [ ] Make redeclarations just the equal operator
- [ ] Fix array members and array member redeclaration bugs

## Note about the name

C. is pronounced like C point. It was named like it and not C dot or period but C point because I just named the executable cpoint without thinking about it and then remembered that it is not a transparent translation from french and that it should have been name ccomma, but hey I am too lazy to fix it  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
