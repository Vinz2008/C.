"Usage : cpoint [options] file\n"
"Options : \n"
"  -std : Select the path where is the std which will be builded\n"
"  -no-std : Make the compiler to not link to the std. It is the equivalent "
"of -freestanding in gcc\n"
"  -c : Create an object file instead of an executable\n"
"  -target-triplet : Select the target triplet to select the target to "
"compile to\n"
"  -verbose-std-build : Make the build of the standard library verbose. It is "
"advised to activate this if the std doesn't build\n"
"  -no-delete-import-file : \n"
"  -no-gc : Make the compiler not add functions for garbage collection\n"
"  -with-gc : Activate the garbage collector explicitally (it is by default "
"activated)\n"
"  -no-imports : Deactivate imports in the compiler\n"
"  -rebuild-gc : Force rebuilding the garbage collector\n"
"  -no-rebuild-std : Make the compiler not rebuild the standard library. You "
"probably only need to rebuild it when you change the target\n"
"  -linker-flags=[flags] : Select additional linker flags\n"
"  -d : Activate debug mode to see debug logs\n"
"  -o : Select the output file name\n"
"  -g : Enable debuginfos\n"
"  -silent : Make the compiler silent\n"
"  -build-mode : Select the build mode (release or debug)\n"
"  -fPIC : Make the compiler produce position-independent code\n"
"  -compile-time-sizeof : The compiler gets the size of types at compile "
"time\n"
"  -test : Compile tests\n"
"  -run-test : Run tests\n"
